.SYNOPSIS
Identifies operator alignment opportunities in a specific PowerShell script file.

.DESCRIPTION
This script analyzes a single PowerShell file to identify potential operator
alignment issues that could improve code readability. It detects:
1. Consecutive variable assignments that could benefit from vertical alignment
2. Hashtable assignments with unaligned operators
3. Other operator alignment opportunities

The script does not modify files, only reports alignment opportunities for manual review.

.PARAMETER FilePath
The path to the specific PowerShell script file to analyze.

.PARAMETER WhatIf
Shows what would be analyzed without making actual changes (informational only).

.EXAMPLE
.\Align-OperatorsVertically.ps1 -FilePath "C:\Scripts\MyScript.ps1"
Analyzes the specified PowerShell file for alignment opportunities.

.EXAMPLE
.\Align-OperatorsVertically.ps1 -FilePath ".\Test-Script.ps1"
Analyzes a PowerShell file in the current directory for alignment opportunities.
