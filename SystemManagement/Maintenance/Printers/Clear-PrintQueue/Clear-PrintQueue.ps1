.SYNOPSIS
Clears all jobs from the Windows print queue and restarts the Print Spooler service.

.DESCRIPTION
This script retrieves all current print jobs using the Win32_PrintJob WMI/CIM class and removes them.
It then stops and starts the Print Spooler (spooler) service.
Requires administrative privileges to run.
Includes -WhatIf support to show what actions would be taken without actually performing them.

.EXAMPLE
PS C:\> .\Clear-PrintQueue.ps1
Attempting to clear print queue and restart Print Spooler service...
Print queue is already clear.
Stopping Print Spooler service (spooler)...
Print Spooler service stopped.
Starting Print Spooler service (spooler)...
Print Spooler service started successfully.
Print queue cleared and Print Spooler service restarted successfully.
[Description: Clears the print queue and restarts the spooler service.]

.EXAMPLE
PS C:\> .\Clear-PrintQueue.ps1 -WhatIf
What if: Performing the operation "Remove" on target "Print Job ID: 1, Document: Microsoft Word - Document1".
What if: Performing the operation "Stop" on target "Service: spooler".
What if: Performing the operation "Start" on target "Service: spooler".
[Description: Shows which print jobs would be removed and indicates that the spooler service would be stopped and started, but does not perform these actions.]

.NOTES
Requires running as Administrator.
Uses Get-CimInstance and standard service cmdlets.
Ensure you have the necessary permissions to manage print jobs and services.

        This function provides colored output while maintaining compatibility with PSScriptAnalyzer
        by using only Write-Output and standard PowerShell cmdlets. Supports both PowerShell 5.1
        and PowerShell 7+ with appropriate color handling for each version.
