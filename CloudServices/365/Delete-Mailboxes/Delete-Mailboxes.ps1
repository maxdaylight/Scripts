.SYNOPSIS
    Deletes multiple Exchange mailboxes from a list provided in a text file.
.DESCRIPTION
    This script automates the process of deleting multiple Exchange mailboxes by:
     - Reading a list of users from a specified text file
     - Verifying Exchange Management Shell is loaded
     - Deleting each mailbox and providing status updates
     - Generating a summary of successful and failed deletions

    Supports -WhatIf parameter to preview changes without making them.

    Dependencies:
     - Exchange Management Shell
     - Text file containing list of mailboxes (one per line)

    Security considerations:
     - Requires Exchange administrator privileges
     - Supports -WhatIf for previewing changes
     - Supports -Confirm for individual confirmations
.PARAMETER userListPath
    Path to the text file containing the list of mailboxes to delete (default: UserList.txt in script directory)
.EXAMPLE
    .\Delete-Mailboxes.ps1
    Reads UserList.txt and attempts to delete all mailboxes listed in the file
.EXAMPLE
    .\Delete-Mailboxes.ps1 -WhatIf
    Shows what mailboxes would be deleted without actually deleting them
.NOTES
    Security Level: High
    Required Permissions: Exchange Administrator
    Validation Requirements: Verify mailbox list before execution
